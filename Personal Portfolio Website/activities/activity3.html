<p><a name="lesson1">Quadratic Equation</a></p>

<p><strong>Quadratic Equation</strong>, a quadratic equation is an algebraic equation of the second degree in x. The quadratic equation in its standard form is a <em>x<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</em>, where a and b are the coefficients, <em>x</em> is the variable, and c is the constant term. The important condition for an equation to be a quadratic equation is the <mark>coefficient</mark> of <em>x<sup>2</sup></em> is a non-zero term <em>(a ≠ 0)</em>. For writing a quadratic equation in standard form, the <em>x<sup>2</sup></em> term is written first, followed by the <em>x</em> term, and finally, the constant term is written. Further, in real math problems the quadratic equations are presented in different forms: <em>(x - 1)(x + 2) = 0, -x<sup>2</sup> = -3x + 1, 5x(x + 3) = 12x, x<sup>3</sup> = x(x<sup>2</sup> + x - 3)</em>. All of these equations need to be transformed into standard form of the quadratic equation before performing further operations.</p>

<p><a name="lesson2">Allotrope</a></p>

<p><strong>Allotrope</strong>, are when atoms of an element can form more than one stable compound. For example, oxygen can form  O<sub>2</sub> <em>(diatomic oxygen)</em> and O<sub>3</sub> <em>(ozone)</em>, which are allotropes. <em>(Not to be confused with isotopes, which are different nuclides of the same element containing different numbers of neutrons)</em>. Selenium forms several allotropes including Se<sub>2</sub>, Se<sub>6</sub> and Se<sub>8</sub>. Note, the most stable allotrope can change as you change the temperature and pressure, for example, at high <em>T (900 <sup>o</sup>C)</em> Se<sub>2</sub> is the most stable, but at lower temperature the larger ones became more stable.</p>
